# Redmine Link Transform for Mattermost Â· ![ci workflow](https://github.com/moddi3/mattermost-plugin-redmine-link/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg) [![Mutable.ai Auto Wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/Auto_Wiki-Mutable.ai-blue)](https://wiki.mutable.ai/moddi3/mattermost-plugin-redmine-link)

This plugin enhances the Mattermost experience by transforming Redmine links in messages into rich content. It automatically extracts information from Redmine issues and presents them in an easy-to-read format.

Automatically transforms Redmine issue links in Mattermost messages into a readable format, providing additional information such as issue status, priority, assignee, and other relevant details directly in the chat.

## Usage

Include Redmine issue links in your Mattermost messages to see the plugin in action. The plugin needs to be configured before use.

### Example

Here's an example of how the plugin transforms Redmine links:

- **Original message**: "Check out the issue here: https://www.redmine.org/issues/3451"
- **Transformed message**: "Check out the issue here: [Defect#3451: Issue Creation Via Email not Working ](https://www.redmine.org/issues/3451 "Assignee: Unassigned&#013;Priority: Normal&#013;Status: Closed&#013;Author: Carlo Camerino&NewLine;Last update: Fri, 16 Jul 2021 15:42:40 EEST")"

In the transformed message, you can view the issue subject and tracker. Additional details such as status, priority, author, and last update date are available when hovering over the link.
#### Example of a transfrmed message in Markdown format:
```
[Defect#3451: Issue Creation Via Email not Working ](https://www.redmine.org/issues/3451 "Assignee: Unassigned&#013;Priority: Normal&#013;Status: Closed&#013;Author: Carlo Camerino&#013;Last update: Fri, 16 Jul 2021 15:42:40 EEST")
```
Carriage Return `&#013;` is used to insert a newline character in the link's title attribute. This allows the additional information (Assignee, Priority, Status, Author, Last update) to be displayed on separate lines when the user hovers over the link or views it in a Markdown renderer that supports tooltips.
